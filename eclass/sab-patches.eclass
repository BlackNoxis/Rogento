# @BLURB: eclass that makes it easier to apply patches from tarballs
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Adds a patch or patches to SRC_URI and makes it easy to apply them.
# It is intended to work with tarballs containing patches, and is
# made to make it easier for Sabayon split ebuilds.
# (Plain patches kept in a VCS are very nice, but in the case of split
# ebuilds, duplicating the patches is not effective.)
# The eclass does not define any phase function.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: SAB_PATCHES_SRC
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array that contains URIs of patches to be added to SRC_URI. Mandatory!

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: SAB_PATCHES_SKIP
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array that contains patterns of patch names to be skipped.
# It does not need to be a global variable.
